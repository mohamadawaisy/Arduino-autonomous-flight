don't change "hello_world - Copy" 
you can edit "hello_world" it's the same project the previous one is backup.

ABOUT ARDUINO PROJECT:
main componenets of arduino code:
1.PIXY CAM - its simply a library that we use to connect pixy cam to arduino. 
2.PID ALGORITHM - Control the drone, we set target and current position, the algorithm output is correction value.
3.SERVO MOTOR - Control joystick...

DOCUMENTATION:

install arduino studio:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

install PixyMon:

steps to run the project:
connect pixy cam with your computer open PixyMon set color signature.
disconnecy the pixy cam from your computer.
connect pixy cam with your arduino by serial cable.
connect the arduino with your computer with usb cable.
run arduino studio, open your arduino code.
press options, choose the COM you already connect your arduino with.
press Run\play.
press on the monitor in the left side and you shuld see the out put.

optional:
open C# project and put the COM you choose in the Openport function and run it.
you should see the current position in realtime.

important:
stop monitoring from arduino studio when start running c# project to avoid clash ,because both use the same serial port.
